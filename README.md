### UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of The Ocean! is to provide a clean, intuitive and fun game for all aged users to play.

#### Player Goals

The general target audience for this game is ages from 6 years upwards.

Players goals are:
- A fun game to play.
- Easy to operate buttons.
- Easy to understand.
- Brightly colored Level difficulty buttons
- A game for all ages.
- Easy has 18 cards, medium has 24 cards and hard has 30 cards.

The Ocean Memory Game is a wonderful way for players to meet these needs because:
- The planning and design took these into account before    building.
- Input was taken from my 6 year old as to what was fun.
- Buttons are grouped together for ease and understanding
- Buttons are brightly colored to show levels, green is go-      easy.
- The feel of the game was vetted by my 6 year old :-)
- With the difficulty levels, the player can start at easy and build up to hard.
- Fun for the whole family.

#### Parent Goals

Parents now days are always looking for something that their child will enjoy, something that is educational and something that is safe. As a parent i listened to what my child would enjoy playing and the memory game was born.

Parent's Goals :
- A game that is educational and that your child can interact with.
- A game that keeps your childs attention.
- A game that challenges your child.
- A game that is visually appealing to your child.
- A mute button ( all parents are saying " thank goodness")

The Ocean memory game is a wonderful way to meet these needs by:
- Being challenging and interactive.
- By testing your childs memory 
- It has been designed so that not only a child but an adult can be entertained.
- The game has 3 difficulty levels to keep the minds sharp.

### Developer Goals

- A well thought out game that cannot be broken by an over excited child starting new levels before finishing and pushing buttons to see what they do.
- A professional looking project that is the beginning of a javascript chapter in this programmers book.

#### User Stories

As a child aged 6 years and up I want:
1.To be able to easily understand the buttons of the game.
2.The ability to choos a level that I am confortable with.
3.Visual images that I recognise and can name or learn the name of.
4. The ability to move between levels as I play.

As the adult player, I want:
1. A visually and appealing game that holds my attention.
2. To be able to play with or compete against my child.
3. To be able to test my own memory.
4. A mute button, so that the sounds can be switched off when they become annoying.

### Design

The overall feel of the game is designed with my daughter in mind. She had a lot of say in the design of the game and what she thought would be fun to play.

**The Colors**

- The colors used were those found in the ocean, soft and easy on the eye. 
- The colors for the buttond were chosen with the traffic light in mind. 
- Green is for go - easy, yellow - is caution - medium and red is stop -hard.

**The Background**
- the background image was chosen by my daughter.

**The Card Images**
- These were chosen with children in mind
- Clear images that children recognise as creatures in the ocean
- Most images children would have seen before.

**Sound**
- To add to the feeling of the game a background sound was added with the option to mute if it gets annoying.

### Wireframes
- These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) in the Scope Plane and planning process for this project.
