### UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of The Ocean! is to provide a clean, intuitive and fun game for all aged users to play.

### Player Goals

The general target audience for this game is ages from 6 years upwards.

Players goals are:
- A fun game to play.
- Easy to operate buttons.
- Easy to understand.
- Brightly colored Level difficulty buttons
- A game for all ages.
- Easy has 18 cards, medium has 24 cards and hard has 30 cards.

The Ocean Memory Game is a wonderful way for players to meet these needs because:
- The planning and design took these into account before building.
- Input was taken from my 6 year old as to what was fun.
- Buttons are grouped together for ease and understanding
- Buttons are brightly colored for ease of level, green is go - easy.
- The feel of the game was vetted by my 6 year old :-)
- With the difficulty levels, the player can start at easy and build up to hard.
- Fun for the whole family.
